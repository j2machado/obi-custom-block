# Obi Custom Block

This is me just messing around with some cool code creating custom blocks for Gutenberg.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your wp-content/plugins directory.  
Then, make sure to run npm i from your terminal.  
  
Activate the plugin. Go to Gutenberg. Search for Obi Custom Block.  
Happy hacking!
